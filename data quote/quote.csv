Motivation
"Please remember that you’re capable, brave and loved – even when it feels like you’re not."
Do not give the past the power to define your future.
Perhaps you’ve been assigned this mountain to show others that it can be moved.
"Just a reminder: it is NOT selfish to put your recovery first. Rather, it’s necessary in order to make sure that everything else doesn’t come last."
"Small, baby steps each day add up to huge, giant leaps over time. So, please keep going.  Do NOT give up."
"You are not worthless, you are not a failure, and you are not a loser. That voice saying you are is just your depression trying to trick you."
"On those really difficult days when it seems impossible to go on and you feel like giving up, just remind yourself that you’ve been there before and you’ve survived every time, so you can survive this time, too."
Even the darkest hour only has 60 minutes.
Perhaps the butterfly is proof that you can go through a great deal of darkness yet become something beautiful again.
"Always try to end the day with a positive thought. No matter how hard things are, tomorrow is a fresh opportunity to make everything better."
"The World Health Organisation estimates that 350 million people suffer from depression worldwide. We know it may not seem like it, but you are NOT alone."
"Don’t hate yourself for everything you aren’t. Instead, love yourself for everything you are. Running away from your problems is a race you’ll never win. Instead, reach out for help and try to confront them."
"Don’t let your struggle become your identity. After all, you are so much more than just your illness."
"Be proud of who you are, instead of ashamed of how someone else sees you."
"Crying doesn’t mean that you’re weak. Since birth, it’s always been a sign that you’re alive. Don’t dwell on those who hold you down. Instead, cherish those who helped you up."
"Never, ever, ever, ever, ever give up on yourself. As long as you keep on fighting, then you can beat your depression."
"Right now, stop whatever you’re doing and think of all the things in life that you are grateful for. This is a really easy way to lift your mood!"
"Even if you can’t see any reason to keep on going, then it doesn’t mean that there aren’t any. It just means that in that moment, your depression is telling you even more lies than usual."
Even the worst depressive episodes won’t last forever.
"Having depression does not mean you are weak, a failure, or worth less than anybody else. Please, don’t discriminate against yourself."
"If you need a confidence booster, then remind yourself of all the difficult things you’ve endured and overcome."
Don’t ruin a good day by thinking about the possibility of a bad day in the future. Just enjoy the present moment
"As Confucius said, our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we do."
"When your depression says, “Give up”, hope whispers, “Try one more time”."
"If you’re worried about telling a friend that you struggle with depression, then remind yourself that you are one of 350 million people battling this illness. So, odds are that even if you don’t know it, one or more of your friends are fighting depression too but are similarly scared to reach out to you."
"You are brave, courageous and strong for continuing to fight an illness that nobody else can see."
"One day, if not already, your refusal to give up will inspire someone else."
Please remember that having a bad day does not mean you have – or will have – a bad life. Hope is one of the most powerful emotions a person can have. Combine it with determination and there’s no stopping you.
"In any given moment, we have two choices: to step forward into growth, or step backwards into safety. Stepping backwards may make us feel better in the short term, but stepping forwards will undoubtedly make us feel better in the long term."
Never put the key to your happiness in someone else’s pocket.
"Just because you’re going through a rough patch, it doesn’t mean you always will be. Recovery is possible. We promise you."
"Just because you have a mental illness, it doesn't mean that you are that illness. You're still a person – just like everybody else."
Recovery is a process. It takes time. It takes patience. It takes hard work. It takes everything you’ve got. But it IS possible.
"Sometimes, you just need to cry your eyes out to be able to keep going. And you know what? That's OK."
"Listen to positive people and ignore negative ones. After all, people who doubt, judge and disrespect you are not worth your energy."
"Healing is a process, not an event. Give it time. Good things happen to those who never give up."
Mental illness is NOT a life sentence.
"Don’t be upset or caught up with things or people you cannot change. Instead, move on, let go, and concentrate on what you can change."
"When your depression tells you that it’s impossible to be free of it, it is LYING!"
"Today, do one little thing to take better care of yourself. Then, do it again tomorrow."
"When something goes wrong, take a moment to be thankful for all the things in your life that are going right."
No-one ever injured their eyesight by looking on the bright side.
You’re allowed to scream. You’re allowed to cry. You’re allowed to fall apart. But you are not allowed to give up.
Scars tell where we have been. They do not have to dictate where we are going.
"Remember, breakdowns can create breakthroughs. Sometimes, things fall apart so that other things can fall together."
Never forget that you are worthy of love and respect.
Sometimes you have to fight through your worst days in order to earn the best days of your life. Remember that life’s greatest lessons are usually learned at the worst times and from the worst mistakes.
"You might be sad because you’ve been through a lot, but you should also be proud of yourself for being strong enough to make it through everything you’ve been through."
"When you say you suffer from a physical illness, you get sympathy. When you say you suffer from depression, you sometimes get blamed. We know it sucks, but at the very least, please take solace in the fact that you are not alone – as evidenced by the fact that 350 million people in the world struggle with depression."
"If someone doesn’t respect you, appreciate you and value you, then they don’t deserve you."
"If you’re going through a hard time right now, make sure you do something today that makes you smile."

"In the context of mental health, courage can be defined as the strength to ask for help."
"Starting today, stop keeping track of all the mistakes you’ve ever made. It’s time to forgive yourself and start being your own best friend."
Always look for something positive in each day ... even if some days you need to look a little harder than others.
"Things may seem gloomy ahead and you may feel like giving up, but if you don’t keep going, then you will never know what is just around the corner."
Sometimes it’s OK if the only thing you did today was breathe.
Never be ashamed of a scar. It simply means that you were stronger than whatever tried to hurt you.
"You are NOT your illness. You have an individual story to tell. You have a name, a history, a personality. Staying yourself is part of the battle."
"It is not weak to say, “I’m not OK, and I need help”. On the contrary, it is brave. It is courageous. And in the end, it could save your life."
"Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remind yourself how far you have come. Remind yourself of everything you have faced, all the battles you have won, and all the fears you have overcome."
"No matter who gives up on you, don’t you ever give up on yourself. Don’t carry your mistakes around with you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as stepping stones."
Never stop doing your best just because someone doesn’t give you credit for it.
Sometimes the hardest part of the journey is believing you’re worth the trip – but we’re here to tell you that you are.
"Life is like a camera: focus on what’s important, capture the good times, develop from the negatives, and if things don’t work out, take another shot. Whatever you do, never forget that you’re human. It’s OK to have a meltdown. Just don’t unpack and live there. Cry it out and then refocus on where you are heading."
Remember: Your illness does not define you. Your strength and your courage does.
"No one is ever too broken, too scarred or too far-gone to recover. If you keep on fighting, then anything’s possible."
"Never let someone who doesn’t know your value tell you how much you’re worth. Never, ever forget that you are special, and that you touch more lives than you’ll ever know."
"Maybe not today, tomorrow, or even in a year, but if you keep fighting and never give up, then things will eventually turn around, and you’ll be able to look back with relief and shout, ‘Yes! I made it!’"
Never forget that walking away from something unhealthy is a very brave thing to do – even if you stumble a little on your way out the door.
Depression is a war. Don’t give up just because you lost a battle.
"Some days, life is all about your dreams, hopes and vision for the future. But on other days, all it’s about is trying to put one foot in front of the other. And you know what? That’s OK. Relationships are like glass – sometimes it’s better to leave them broken than to hurt yourself trying to put them back together."
"MYTH: You will be depressed forever. FACT: With the right help, you can beat your depression and go on to live a happy, healthy, fulfilling life."
"Stop beating yourself up. You are a work in progress, which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once."
"If sometimes all you want is for someone to acknowledge just how difficult struggling with depression is, then here’s your acknowledgement. We understand, and we’re proud of you for not giving up."
"Someday, everything will make perfect sense. So for now, laugh at the confusion, smile through the tears, and keep reminding yourself that everything happens for a reason."
"Don’t compare your progress with that of others. After all, we all need our own time to travel our own distance."
"If you’ve ever had suicidal thoughts, then we’re glad you’re still here. Keep holding on."
Finding the right therapist is a bit like dating ... sometimes you have to try a few before you find a good match.
"Don’t change so people will like you. Be yourself and the right people will love the real you. Don’t look back, because if you do, you might fall over what is in front of you."
"If you’re thinking about giving up today, just live until tomorrow. And when you do, read this again."
"Just because your path is different, it doesn’t mean you’re lost."
"Recovery often involves doing what you should do instead of what you want to do. But in the end, it is so, so worth it."
"You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it, but if you never give up, you will get there eventually."
The past is like an anchor that holds you back. You have to be able to let go of who you were in order to become who you want to be.
"When you find the courage to let go of what you can’t change, you’ll take a giant leap forward in your quest to recover from depression."
"Hating yourself will never, ever get you as far as loving yourself will."
Beautiful things happen when you distance yourself from negativity.
"The world will not end if you do not figure everything out tonight, so stop pacing, stop sweating, and stop fretting. Instead, go to bed and start again tomorrow."
There comes a time when you have to stop crossing oceans for people who wouldn’t jump puddles for you.
"When you focus on problems, you’ll have more problems. When you focus on possibilities, you’ll have more opportunities."
"No matter how far you’ve travelled down the wrong road, you can always turn around and get back on the right track."
"One of the most dangerous myths surrounding depression is that it is a life sentence, when in reality, if you seek the right help and keep on fighting, you CAN recover, and live a happy, healthy, depression-free life."
"When everything feels like an uphill struggle, just think of the view from the top."
"Life has many chapters, and one bad one does not mean that it’s the end of the book."
"If you’re feeling suicidal, write down your dreams. Block everything else out and picture them coming true. Use them as reasons to keep on fighting."
"Eat like you love yourself, move like you love yourself, speak like you love yourself, and act like you love yourself."
"Would you be as critical to your loved ones as you are to yourself? That’s what we thought. Please, be kind to yourself."
"Just because your life may not have turned out the way you’d planned, it doesn’t mean that it won’t turn out OK."
"It’s hard for a person to beat depression, but it’s even harder for depression to beat a person who never gives up."
Being yourself is the prettiest thing you can be.
"No matter what you’re going through right now, having a positive attitude is going to serve you better than having a negative one."
"Instead of counting your troubles, count all the joys you have in life as well."
The most beautiful thing in the world is a smile that has struggled through tears.
"Recovery does not happen linearly. Sometimes you’ll have bad days, sometimes you’ll have setbacks, and sometimes you’ll feel so low and broken that you’ll want to give up. But if you keep taking little steps forward, you’ll eventually get there."
"Depression isn’t pretty, but having depression doesn’t make you ugly. Anxiety is a burden, but having anxiety doesn’t make you a burden. Even though you’re struggling right now, you have nothing to be ashamed of. You are so, so much more than your problems, and you are a warrior for continuing to fight them."
"In case no one told you today: you are beautiful. You are loved. You are needed. You are alive for a reason. You are stronger than you think, and if you keep on fighting, then you’re going to get through this."
You were given this life because you are strong enough to live it.
Don’t compare the lowest points of your life to someone else’s Instagram highlight real and use it as a reason to feel inadequate.
"Today, you don’t need to have all the answers. You just need to know what to do next."
"If you do everything you can to keep on fighting, then even if they don’t tell you, there’ll be people who’ll find your plight with depression inspiring."
"Don’t be ashamed of the times you fell. Instead, be proud of all the times you got back up."
In case you didn’t know: studies show that 80% of the things we worry about happening never actually happen.
"Having depression is NOT a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of being human, and anyone who tells you otherwise doesn’t understand this illness."
Guilt is toxic. Reliving the same mistake over and over again is torture. Constantly criticising and blaming yourself is bullying. Break free of this cycle. Reflect. Learn. Grow. Love yourself. Forgive yourself.
"Instead of always focusing on how far you have left to go, make sure you also remember how far you have come."
This is just a little reminder that you deserve to be treated as well as you treat everybody else. Don’t accept anything less!
It is better to be an imperfect version of yourself than a perfect version of somebody else.
"Hope and depression are bitter rivals until one, always and inevitably, defeats the other. Someone failing to see the best in you does not diminish your worth as a person."
"Try not to get so comfortable with your demons that you accept them as being a part of you. Instead, seek help so that you can work on liberating yourself from them."
"Admitting that you’re not OK is NOT a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of self-awareness, maturity, and emotional strength."
"Making mistakes does not mean you’ve failed. Rather, it means you had the courage to try, and if you learn from those mistakes, then you’ll soon succeed."
"Don’t let negative, toxic, insecure people drag you down to their level."
"Is whatever you’re frustrated about worth ruining the hour, the day, the week?"
We cannot in a minute get rid of unhealthy habits we’ve been practising for a lifetime. That’s why it takes time for therapy to work.
Don’t ruin a good day by thinking about the possibility of a bad day in the future. Just enjoy the present moment.
"If you can’t figure out where you stand with someone, then it might be time to stop standing and start walking."
"One day, you’ll wake up and realise that the pain’s still there but that it doesn’t hurt quite as much as it used to. That’s when you’re on the road to healing."
"Try not to be discouraged by setbacks. Instead, try to be encouraged by the fact that you have the chance to overcome them."
You deserve as much love and support as anybody else.
Being imperfect doesn’t mean you’re unworthy. It means you’re human.
Anxiety serves no purpose other than stealing today’s joy.
Worrying doesn’t empty tomorrow of its sorrows; it empties today of its strengths.
Anxiety is like a rocking chair. It gives you something to do but it doesn’t get you very far.
Anxiety is experiencing failure and defeat in advance. Don’t waste your time.
Don’t believe every worried thought you have. Worried thoughts are notoriously inaccurate.
No amount of regret can change the past. No amount of anxiety can change the future.
"Our anxiety does not come from thinking about the future, but from wanting to control it."
Stop trying to calm the storm. Calm yourself. The storm will pass
You must learn to let go. Release the stress. You were never in control anyway
Your anxiety is lying to you. You are loved and you are going to be okay.
Anxiety is the fear of more fear.
When you’re feeling anxious remember that you’re still you. You are not your anxiety
The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another
"Stress does more than make you sick it destroys your peace, hope, and dreams."
Most things we worry about never happen.
"You cannot always control what goes on outside, but you can always control what goes on inside"
"If you want to conquer the anxiety of life, live in the moment, live in the breath."
"Smile, breathe, and go slowly"
"Don’t be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams"
What else does anxiety about the future bring you but sorrow upon sorrow.
"If it won’t matter in a year from now, or even a month, it shouldn’t matter now"
There is nothing in this world that can trouble you as much as your own thoughts.
"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them"
"You can do anything, but not everything."
"It’s not the stress that kills us, it’s our reaction to it"
Note to self: Everything is going to be okay.
"If you treat every situation as a life and death matter, you’ll die a lot of times"
"You’re only here for a short visit. Don’t hurry, don’t worry. And be sure to smell the flowers along the way."
"Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself."
Learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace
"Your mind will believe everything you tell it. Feed it love, truth, faith, and hope"
"Remember, you survived 100% of your worst days"
"The day you stop worrying will be the first day of your new life; anxiety takes you in circles, trust in yourself and become free."
Worry is a down payment on a problem you may never have
"Stop overthinking. If it’s not meant to be, it’s not meant to be"
Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations
Close your eyes. Clear your heart. Let it go
Worrying is like walking around with an umbrella waiting for it to rain
"Fear and anxiety many times indicates that we are moving in a positive direction, out of the same confines of our comfort zone, and in the direction of our true purpose."
"You don’t have to control your thoughts, you just have to stop letting them control you"
There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.
"Trust yourself. You’ve survived a lot, and you’ll survive whatever is coming"
Anxiety is nothing but repeatedly experiencing failure in advance. What a waste
"Rule number one is don’t sweat the small stuff. Rule number two, it’s all small stuff"
"If it’s not going to matter in five years, don’t spend five minutes being upset about it."
You can’t calm the storm. So stop trying. What you can do is calm yourself. The storm will pass
Breathe. You’re going to be okay. You’ve gotten through so many things in your life. You’ve got this
Flowers grow back even after the harshest winters. You will too.
Fear thrives in a place of inaction. Overcome your anxiety by taking one small step forward
"You don’t have to control your thoughts, you just have to let them stop controlling you"
"Remember how far you’ve come, not just how far you have to go. You are not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be"
You are going to overcome what you’re currently struggling with. Be patient. You’re going to be okay
Learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace
"Whatever happens around you, don’t take it personally…Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves"
"You don’t always need a plan. Sometimes you just need to breathe, trust, let go, and see what happens"
Your anxiety is lying to you. You are loved and are going to be okay.
You’re a fighter. Look at everything you’ve overcome. Don’t give up now
Choose to be optimistic. It feels better
"Close your eyes and imagine the best version of you possible, that’s who you really are. Let go of any part of you that doesn’t believe it"
Feel the feeling but don’t become the emotion. Witness it. Allow it. Release it
"You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending"
"When thinking about the future, remember this: no amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of anxiety can change the future."
Don’t be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.
Don’t forget that you’re human. It’s okay if you have a meltdown. Just don’t unpack and live there. Cry it out. Then refocus on where your headed
"Every time you are tempted to react in the same old way, ask if you want to be a prisoner of the past or a pioneer of the future"
You don’t have to control your thoughts. You just have to stop letting them control you
Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.
"P.S. You’re not going to die. Here’s the white-hot truth: if you go bankrupt, you’ll still be okay. If you lose the gig, the lover, the house, you’ll still be okay. If you sing off-key, get beat by the competition, have your heart shattered, get fired…it’s not going to kill you. Ask anyone who’s been through it"
You wouldn’t worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do
You can’t always control what goes on outside. But you can always control what goes on inside
Do not let your difficulties fill you with anxiety; after all it is only in the darkest nights that stars shine more brightly
"It’s OKAY to be scared. Being scared means you’re about to do something really, really brave"
"Anxiety was born in the very same moment as mankind. And since we will never be able to master it, we will have to learn to live with it—just as we have learned to live with storms"
"I promise you nothing is as chaotic as it seems. Nothing is worth diminishing your health. Nothing is worth poisoning yourself into stress, anxiety, and fear"
Present fears are less than horrible imaginings
"Hey you, keep living. It won’t always be this overwhelming"
Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest taken between two deep breaths
"When I look back on all these worries, I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which had never happened"
"If you treat every situation as a life and death matter, you’ll die a lot of times."
Every tomorrow has two handles. We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith
"Rule number one is, don’t sweat the small stuff. Rule number two is, it’s all small stuff."
"Worry a little bit every day and in a lifetime you will lose a couple of years. If something is wrong, fix it if you can. But train yourself not to worry. Worry never fixes anything"
What people in the world think of you is really none of your business
All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.
"When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change."
"At the end of the day, tell yourself gently: ‘I love you, you did the best you could today, and even if you didn’t accomplish all you had planned, I love you anyway"
Life is 10% of what you experience and 90% of how you respond to it.
"Take chances, make mistakes. That’s how you grow. Pain nourishes your courage. You have to fail in order to practice being brave"
"If you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude"
"n order to move on, you must understand why you felt what you did and why you no longer need to feel it"
Sometimes letting things go is an act of far greater power than defending or hanging on.
"When I let go of what I am, I become what I want to be"
"Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do, but it gets you nowhere"
"Fear exists only in your mind, not in nature. Detach yourself, be strong, trust life, and become life"
No amount of anxiety can change the future. No amount of regret can change the past
"The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, not to worry about the future, not to anticipate the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly"
Don’t worry about achieving. Don’t worry about perfection. Just be there each moment as best you can
"Worrying is carrying tomorrow's load with today's strength- carrying two days at once. It is moving into tomorrow ahead of time. Worrying doesn't empty tomorrow of its sorrow, it empties today of its strength."
"If you aren’t in the moment, you are either looking forward to uncertainty or back to pain and regret"
"Anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrows, but only empties today of its strength"
How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened
"Just when the caterpillar thought the world was ending, he turned into a butterfly"
You don’t have to control your thoughts; you just have to stop letting them control you
"If we wanted to change the situation, we first had to change ourselves. And to change ourselves effectively, we first had to change our perceptions"
A positive attitude gives you power over your circumstances instead of your circumstances having power over you
"It’s not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it"
"Some days, doing ‘the best we can’ may still fall short of what we would like to be able to do, but life isn’t perfect—on any front—and doing what we can with what we have is the most we should expect of ourselves or anyone else"
"Surrender to what is, let go of what was, and have faith in what will be."
Whatever happens to you belongs to you. Make it yours. Feed it to yourself even if it feels impossible to swallow. Let it nurture you because it will
The universe doesn’t allow perfection
Nothing is permanent in this wicked world—not even our troubles
"For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business"
"I tell you the past is a bucket of ashes, so live not in your yesterdays, not just for tomorrow, but in the here and now."
What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us
"You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn to surf"
"You cannot make yourself feel something you do not feel, but you can make yourself do right in spite of your feelings"
The greatest mistake we make is living in constant fear that we will make one
"You can’t go back and make a new start, but you can start right now and make a brand new ending"
We're all spending way too much of our time and energy trying to fight the stuff we can't change
Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow; it only saps today of its strength
Life does not have to be perfect to be wonderful
Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to the error that counts
"Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be"
Anxiety is something that is part of me but it’s not who I am
"The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere"
Success is not final; failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts
"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall"
"Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be"
"Do what you can, with what you’ve got, where you are"
"We live only a few conscious decades, and we fret ourselves enough for several lifetimes"
"Whatever is going to happen will happen, whether we worry or not"
A lonely day is God’s way of saying that he wants to spend some quality time with you
Loneliness adds beauty to life. It puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better
"I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity"
"I had already found that it was not good to be alone, and so made companionship with what there was around me, sometimes with the universe and sometimes with my own insignificant self; but my books were always my friends, let fail all else"
The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.
"A man can be himself only so long as he is alone; and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only when he is alone that he is really free."
Remember: the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself. Life’s cruelest irony.
The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself
I am stronger than depression and I am braver than loneliness and nothing will ever exhaust me
"If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself"
If you are alone you belong entirely to yourself. If you are accompanied by even one companion you belong only half to yourself.
I think it’s good for a person to spend time alone. It gives them an opportunity to discover who they are.
"When you’re surrounded by all these people, it can be lonelier than when you’re by yourself. You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don’t feel like you can trust anyone or talk to anybody, you feel like you’re really alone"
Loneliness is the poverty of self; solitude is richness of self
The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!
Love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you.
"Because once alone, it is impossible to believe that one could ever have been otherwise. Loneliness is an absolute discovery"
My happiness will remain in everything with which God so generously surrounds human loneliness
"It is in your power to withdraw yourself whenever you desire. Perfect tranquility within consists in the good ordering of the mind, the realm of your own"
"In order to be open to creativity, one must have the capacity for constructive use of solitude. One must overcome the fear of being alone."
Loneliness is the human condition. Cultivate it. The way it tunnels into you allows your soul room to grow.
"Perhaps only people who are capable of real togetherness have that look of being alone in the universe. The others have a certain stickiness, they stick to the mass."
"So many people are shut up tight inside themselves like boxes, yet they would open up, unfolding quite wonderfully, if only you were interested in them."
"Are you upset little friend? Have you been lying awake worrying? Well, don’t worry…I’m here. The flood waters will recede, the famine will end, the sun will shine tomorrow, and I will always be here to take care of you."
"I need to be alone. I need to ponder my shame and my despair in seclusion; I need the sunshine and the paving stones of the streets without companions, without conversation, face to face with myself, with only the music of my heart for company"
