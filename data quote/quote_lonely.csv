Motivation
A lonely day is God’s way of saying that he wants to spend some quality time with you
Loneliness adds beauty to life. It puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better
"I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the years of maturity"
"I had already found that it was not good to be alone, and so made companionship with what there was around me, sometimes with the universe and sometimes with my own insignificant self; but my books were always my friends, let fail all else"
The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.
"A man can be himself only so long as he is alone; and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only when he is alone that he is really free."
Remember: the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself. Life’s cruelest irony.
The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself
I am stronger than depression and I am braver than loneliness and nothing will ever exhaust me
"If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself"
If you are alone you belong entirely to yourself. If you are accompanied by even one companion you belong only half to yourself.
I think it’s good for a person to spend time alone. It gives them an opportunity to discover who they are.
"When you’re surrounded by all these people, it can be lonelier than when you’re by yourself. You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don’t feel like you can trust anyone or talk to anybody, you feel like you’re really alone"
Loneliness is the poverty of self; solitude is richness of self
The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!
Love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you.
"Because once alone, it is impossible to believe that one could ever have been otherwise. Loneliness is an absolute discovery"
My happiness will remain in everything with which God so generously surrounds human loneliness
"It is in your power to withdraw yourself whenever you desire. Perfect tranquility within consists in the good ordering of the mind, the realm of your own"
"In order to be open to creativity, one must have the capacity for constructive use of solitude. One must overcome the fear of being alone."
Loneliness is the human condition. Cultivate it. The way it tunnels into you allows your soul room to grow.
"Perhaps only people who are capable of real togetherness have that look of being alone in the universe. The others have a certain stickiness, they stick to the mass."
"So many people are shut up tight inside themselves like boxes, yet they would open up, unfolding quite wonderfully, if only you were interested in them."
"Are you upset little friend? Have you been lying awake worrying? Well, don’t worry…I’m here. The flood waters will recede, the famine will end, the sun will shine tomorrow, and I will always be here to take care of you."
"I need to be alone. I need to ponder my shame and my despair in seclusion; I need the sunshine and the paving stones of the streets without companions, without conversation, face to face with myself, with only the music of my heart for company"
